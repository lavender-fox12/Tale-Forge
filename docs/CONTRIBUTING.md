# üåà Contributing to Tale Forge: Let's Spin Tales Together! üåà

Hey there, amazing storyteller! We're so thrilled you want to add your sparkle to Tale Forge. To keep our stories harmonious and our community happy, please take a moment to read these friendly guidelines.

## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Contribute to a Story

1.  **Find Your Adventure:** Browse the "Tale Forge" hub (our little website!) to discover a story that calls to you. Each story card links directly to its collaborative document.
2.  **Access the Document:** Click the "Join the Tale!" button on the story card. This will take you to a public Google Doc (or Notion page) where the story lives.
3.  **Dive In & Create!**
    * **Respect the Flow:** Read the existing story to understand its tone, characters, and plot. Try to seamlessly extend what's already there.
    * **Be Mindful of Length:** While there's no strict word count, try to contribute in reasonable chunks. A few paragraphs or a short chapter is often perfect.
    * **Keep it PG (and PG-Cute!):** Remember, our forge is a cozy, family-friendly space. Keep contributions appropriate for all ages and maintain a positive, uplifting tone.
    * **Avoid Destructive Editing:** Please only *add* to the story. Do not delete or significantly alter others' contributions without prior discussion (see "Proposing Changes").
    * **Formatting Matters:** Try to match the existing formatting (font, size, spacing) of the document for a cohesive look.

## üí° Proposing New Story Ideas

Got a brilliant spark for a new tale? We'd love to hear it!

1.  **Go to GitHub Issues:** Head over to the `Issues` section of our `tale_forge` GitHub repository.
2.  **Open a New Issue:** Click "New Issue" and select a "New Story Idea" template (if available, otherwise choose "Open a blank issue").
3.  **Describe Your Idea:**
    * Give your story a charming title!
    * Write a short, exciting premise (e.g., "A grumpy wizard accidentally turns his cat into a teacup!").
    * Suggest a genre (e.g., fantasy, mystery, slice-of-life).
    * Briefly outline any initial characters or settings.
4.  **Community Discussion:** Other contributors will chime in, share their thoughts, and if there's enough excitement, we'll create a new collaborative document and add its link to the `docs/story_links/` folder!

## üöß Moderation & Discussion

To keep Tale Forge a happy and creative place:

* **Reporting Concerns:** If you notice a contribution that seems off-topic, inappropriate, or harmful, please open an issue on GitHub with details. Be kind and constructive!
* **Disputes & Changes:** If you want to suggest a significant change to an existing part of a story, *do not edit directly*. Instead, open an issue on GitHub to discuss it with the community first. We believe in collaborative consensus!
* **Friendly Feedback:** When offering feedback, always be encouraging and constructive. We're all here to have fun and grow together!

Thank you for being a part of our whimsical storytelling journey! Let's create something magical. üíñ
